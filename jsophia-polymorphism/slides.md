# JS polymorphism introduction


What is polymorphism ?
- Polymorphism is when calling same method in different objects and getting different behaviours.
- It's the fact of making a noise of a dog and different meaw for a cat.
- It's closely linked to inheritance

# Types of Polymorphism in JavaScript

## Method Override

To redefine a method in a child class
Example : Dog class redefine method speak() and result is 'le chien aboie'

- Create parent class
  First is to define parent class, in this example `Animal` which contains method speak()
  It's a generic method which just define a noise
- Define children classes : In order to define specific behaviour
- Redefine method
- Usage and invoke the method
- Execution and results

## Ad Hoc polymorphism (Overloading)

It's the way to use operator with different types, which leads to different behaviours. We can take the example of concatenation.

```js {all} twoslash
10 + 10; // will print 20
 'I am' + ' ' + '5 years old' // will print I am 5 years old
```
In this example operator + treats type number and type string differently

## Parameteric polymorphism

In this example of parameters polymorphism, Javascript does not distiguish between type number or string.
Parametric polymorphism is the way to treat different types similarly

```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
// More at https://shiki.style/packages/twoslash
const Leo = ['Leo', 'Kim', 4, false];
console.log("Leo: "+Leo);
const Ann = {
    firstName: "Leo",
    lastName: "",
    Age: 4,
    Adult: false};
console.log(JSON.stringify(Ann, 2));
```

# Some other examples

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly, and even types hover!

```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
// More at https://shiki.style/packages/twoslash

function cumulateShapes(gShapes){
    return gShapes.reduce((sum, shape) => {
        if (shape instanceof GeometricShape){
            console.log(`Shape: ${shape.toString()} - area: ${shape.area()}`);
            console.log(
              `Shape: ${shape.toString()} - perimeter: ${shape.perimeter()}`
            );
            return sum + shape.area();
          }
          throw Error("Bad argument shape.");
    },0);
}

const shapes = [new EqTriangle(3,5), new Rectangle(2,3)];

console.log(cumulateShapes(shapes));
```

# Performance impact considerations
- Monomorphic functions remains faster in execution
- It's worth to use polymorphism for code reuse

# Session stack study

Some opensource tools live demo for session record and replay: https://www.rrweb.io/#demos
What's SessionStack AI enhanced tool?

## Browser state changes

Sample code snippet
```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
console.log("Browser state change with url visiting demo");
```

## Segment filters

Sample code snippet
```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
console.log("HTML state change demo");
```

### Dead click 
Dead clicks are clicks or taps that do not affect the page with changes such as:

- DOM events
- URL changes
- Console Log Events

Which indicates poor UX

Sample code snippet
```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
console.log("Dead click demo");
```

### Rage click

A rage click occurs when a user performs multiple quick clicks on the same element in a row. Among the possible explanations are:

- The user does not understand which is a clickable element 
- Buttons, links, and icons do not function properly
- Unable to click because of the invisible overlay above everything

Sample code snippet
```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
console.log("Rage click demo");
```

### User input

- Option CSS selector
- Option "Text" and "Text contains"

---
transition: slide-up

### Custom events

Sample code snippet
```js {all|5|7|7-8|10|all} twoslash
console.log("Add to cart evt 'DÃ©poser une annonce Le bon coin' demo")
```
